# Dapper Muffalo

Go to [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541725465) for the Steam version.

## Description
A muffalo with a top hat and a monocle. Quite a lot more rare than their savage cousins. Their intellect is more advanced than what normal muffalos have and that is reflected in their train-ability. They will take you to victory.
